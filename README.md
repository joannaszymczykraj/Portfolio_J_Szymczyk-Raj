# Software Tester Portfolio - Joanna Szymczyk-Raj

## :sparkles: About me

<b>Hello World,</b><p></p>
my name is Joanna Szymczyk-Raj. Probably, my story is many - at the beginning of 2023 I decided that it was time for a professional change. Among the many opportunities offered on the labor market, my choice definitely fell on the development towards software testing.
My several years of experience as a project manager in a farma marketing company taught me meticulousness, responsibility, work strongly subordinated to changes and deadlines. First of all, I learned how to work with clients and work that fully meets their business expectations.

<p></p>:eight_spoked_asterisk: inquisitiveness
<p></p>:eight_spoked_asterisk: consistency in action
<p></p>:eight_spoked_asterisk: analytical thinking
<p></p>putting in hard work, I have the potential to succeed in the profession of a software tester.

I am convinced that this will prove invaluable in the work of a manual tester.
<p></p>
I feel that as a manual tester I will find what I am looking for - <b>passion, balance and an endless path of development.</b>
<p></p>
In the future I would like to develop to quality assurance especially around  such technologies as <b>databases, rest API, moving towards automatic testing.</b>
